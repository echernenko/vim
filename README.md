# vim

Quick guide on configuring vim.

1. `vim` is usually installed. 
    TODO: give instructions on installation if it is not available in target environment.
2. copy `.vimrc` to your home directory. It has some sensible defaults like: spaces for 
    tabulation, 4 spaces by default, showing line numbers, highlighting syntax etc.

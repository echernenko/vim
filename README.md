# vim

Quick guide on configuring vim.

1. `vim` is usually installed. 
    TODO: give instructions on installation if it is not available in target environment.
2. Copy `.vimrc` to your home directory. It has some sensible defaults like: spaces for 
    tabulation, 4 spaces by default, showing line numbers, highlighting syntax etc.
3. Install few plugins, that will make vim environment more like IDE-style:
- `nerdtree` (file tree explorer) https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree
- `syntastic` (syntax checker, like ESLint) https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic
- `fzf` (fuzzy files finder by name) https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim
